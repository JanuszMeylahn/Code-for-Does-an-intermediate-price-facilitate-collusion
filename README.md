# Code for: Does an intermediate price facilitate collusion?
Code for reproducing the results of the article: Does an intermediate price facilitate collusion?

This repository contains the Mathematica and python codes for reproducing the results of the article: Does an intermediate price facilitate collusion? A preprint of the article can be found at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4594415

To reproduce the Mathematica results, ensure that you have an installation of Mathematica, download the .zip file, extract the .nb file and open it with Mathematica. Code can be executed by clicking on the block containing the code and simultaneously pressing shift and enter. Instructions and an explanation of the code are included in the Mathematica file. 

To reproduce the python simulation, a working installation of numba is required. The python simulation produces .txt files containing the results of the simulation which were plotted using Mathematica for the article.
